## Automation Bootcamp Source Code & Examples 

This Project holds the source code and examples of our provided automation bootcamp. We have different modules included and every module it self will have some examples and descriptions how to use. 

The content is for beginners in infrastructure automation and covers the topics:
- git
- ansible
- circle ci 
- terraform

You can try it out by yourself, but we recommend to join our trainings session and the automation tribe.

## Requirements

The requirements are depending on what kind of trainings module you want to run and you wanna try out. You will find a detailed description on the required tools and prerequisits in the module section. For the current course everything will be installed on the Jenkins or student machines and can be executed. 

## Usage
You can navigate to the modules and you will find example code and exercises which you can do by your own. For the current AutomationBootcamp we have a cloud setup with AWS. The Git remote repo we are using depends on the current use case and will be Innersource or your personal Github.
